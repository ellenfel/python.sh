## Learning Resources
1. Books:
   - "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by Michael T. Goodrich
   - "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python" by Brad Miller and David Ranum

2. Online Platforms:
   - LeetCode
   - HackerRank
   - CodeSignal
   - GeeksforGeeks

3. Practice Strategy:
   - Start with basic implementations
   - Understand time and space complexity
   - Solve at least 5 problems per data structure
   - Focus on pattern recognition
   - Keep track of common interview questions

## Getting Started
1. Create the project structure
2. Start with basic data structures
3. Implement each data structure from scratch
4. Solve practice problems
5. Document your learning and solutions

## Tips for Success
- Practice consistently
- Understand the theory before implementation
- Write clean, well-documented code
- Test your implementations thoroughly
- Review and optimize your solutions
- Keep track of your progress

Remember: The key to mastering data structures is consistent practice and understanding the underlying concepts. Don't rush through the topics - take your time to fully understand each data structure and its applications.
