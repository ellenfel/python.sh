# Python Data Structures Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn and practice data structures in Python, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. The project follows a structured approach to learning data structures, from basic to advanced concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several main directories:

- `basic/`: Contains implementations of basic data structures
- `advanced/`: Contains more complex data structures
- `graphs/`: Contains graph-related data structures and algorithms
- `advanced_topics/`: Contains specialized data structures

Each directory contains:
- Implementation files
- Test files
- Practice problems
- Documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use This Project

1. Follow the roadmap.md file for learning progression
2. Start with basic data structures
3. Implement each data structure from scratch
4. Solve the practice problems
5. Document your learning and solutions

## Testing

Each data structure implementation includes test cases. Run tests using:
```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Contributing

Feel free to:
- Add more practice problems
- Improve existing implementations
- Add more test cases
- Suggest improvements
